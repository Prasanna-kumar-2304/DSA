754. Reach a Number (https://leetcode.com/problems/reach-a-number/)

You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target. You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:

On each move, you can either go left or right.
During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.
Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.

Example 1:

Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        int pos = 0;
        int moves = 0;
        int step = 1;
        target = Math.abs(target);
        while(true){
            if(pos>=target){
                if((pos-target)%2 != 0){
                    pos = pos+step;
                    step++;
                    moves++;
                }
                else{
                    break;
                }
            }
            else{
                pos = pos+step;
                step++;
                moves++;
            }
        }
        return moves;
    }
}
