69. Sqrt(x) (https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator. For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 
Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = x;
        int mid = 0;
        if(x == 0 || x == 1) return x;

        while(left<=right){ 
            mid = left+(right-left)/2;
            long sqrt = (long) mid*mid;

            if(sqrt == (long)x){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(sqrt>(long)x){
                right = mid-1;
            }
            else{
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
}
