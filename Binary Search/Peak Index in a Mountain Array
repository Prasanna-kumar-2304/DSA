852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array (https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/)

You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
Return the index of the peak element. Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,0]
Output: 1

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length-1;
        int mid = 0;
        while(left<right){
            mid = left+(right-left)/2;

            if(arr[mid]>arr[mid+1]){
                right = mid;
            }
            else{
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }
}
