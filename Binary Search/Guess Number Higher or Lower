374. Guess Number Higher or Lower (https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Solution:
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = n;
        int mid = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        while(left<=right){
            mid = left+(right-left)/2;

            if(guess(mid) == 0){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(guess(mid) == 1){
                left = mid+1;
            }
            else if(guess(mid) == -1){
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return mid;
    }
}
