1854. Maximum Population Year (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/description/)

You are given a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [birthi, deathi] indicates the birth and death years of the ith person.

The population of some year x is the number of people alive during that year. The ith person is counted in year x's population if x is in the inclusive range [birthi, deathi - 1]. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.
Return the earliest year with the maximum population.

Example 1:

Input: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
Output: 1993
Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {
        int[] year = new int[2051];
        		
        for(int[] log : logs){
            
            year[log[0]] += 1;
            year[log[1]] -= 1;
        }
        
        int maxNum = year[1950], maxYear = 1950;
        
        for(int i = 1951; i < year.length; i++){
            year[i] += year[i - 1];
            
            if(year[i] > maxNum){
                maxNum = year[i];
                maxYear = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxYear;
    }
}
