1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix (https://leetcode.com/problems/cells-with-odd-values-in-a-matrix/)

There is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. There is also a 2D array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.
For each location indices[i], do both of the following:

Increment all the cells on row ri.
Increment all the cells on column ci.
Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.

Example 1:

Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix is [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]], which contains 6 odd numbers.

Solution:

class Solution {
    public int oddCells(int m, int n, int[][] indices) {
        int[] row = new int[m], col = new int[n];
        for (int[] arr : indices) {
            row[arr[0]]++;
            col[arr[1]]++;
        }
        int oddRow = 0, oddCol = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            if (row[i] % 2 == 1)
                oddRow++;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            if (col[i] % 2 == 1)
                oddCol++;
        return oddRow * (n - oddCol) + (m - oddRow) * oddCol;
    }
}
